                <p>Hello! I'm Matt, a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Economics. In landing several rigorous internships in the Finance and Consulting industries throughout my time in college, I mastered the many moving parts needed to land these high-demand low-supply positions. Using my experience<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">, I developed a full college career building course to help parents and high school seniors get ahead of the curve when it comes to landing career-accelerating internships in college. While you may believe that your future college studentâ€™s university will provide this kind of guidance, the unfortunate truth is that fewer than 1 in 5 undergraduate students seek help through university sponsored career resources when applying to internships. Rather than rolling the dice against this statistic, you can take action with my course.</span></p>

                Out of the 61% of college students that manage to land internships during their 4 years in school, nearly 40% of these positions are unpaid. Strikingly, when a college student has a <i>paid &nbsp;</i>internship under their belt, their chances at being employed full-time upon graduation are 34% greater than those with an unpaid internship. In taking this course, you will send your future college student off to school with an arsenal of college career building information that took me years to gather from the most rigorous student organizations within a top public university. We start with providing you the tools to help your future college student craft the perfect pre-college resume, and eventually end with a case study showing how your future college student can tailor their application documents for a specific internship. What lies in between is an array of tools to help your future college student create and manage professional relationships through conversation logging and LinkedIn. <a href="" id="join-link" target="_blank">Join me</a>, and let's redefine the college guidance process.</p>
