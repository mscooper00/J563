                <p>Hello! I'm Matt, a junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Economics. Throughout all of college, I have dedicated my time to building a successful college career. That is, a college career full of internships and career-boosting opportunities. In doing so, I managed to land high-level internships in rigorous industries such as Finance and Consulting. This journey taught me the many moving parts needed to land these high-demand low-supply positions as a college student, such as how to manage professional relationships, how to become a member of the most selective university organizations, and how to create resume enhancing opportunities (yes, there's a blueprint process for these things).</p>

                Using my experience, I developed a full college career building course meant for parents of teens who are within a year of starting college (of course, it would be best if your future college student took this course alongside you). For far too long the college guidance process has been lasor focused on how to get your teen into college, and nothing else. The truth is that what your teen does once they arrive to campus is infinitely more important than any other part of the college process. My goal for this course is to supply invaluable college career building information that will set your future college student up for a degree full of career boosting opportunities. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Join me</a> and let's redefine the college guidance process.</p>
